# Malware Analysis

## To start the app, clone this repo and cd into the directory.   

Open a terminal and type in
### `npm install`
This will install all the required dependencies. Then, in the same terminal, type
### `npm start`   

While the app starts, open another terminal and type in
### `nodemon backend/server.js`   

Then, open another terminal and type in
### `cd backend`
### `pip install fastapi uvicorn angr capstone matplotlib.pyplot`
Once the dependencies are installed, type in
### `uvicorn main:app --reload`   

After a while, this should open the web app in your browser where you can test it out.   

## For the `.env` file, use the following template which can also be found in the `.env.example` in the `backend/` directory
> API_KEY=
> MONGODB_PORT=127.0.0.1
Fill the first field with VirusTotal API key. Place this `.env` file inside the `backend/` directory.

The control flow graph displayed on the browser must be very hard to zoom into and get a better look at the details.
Instead, if you directly the run the `backend/cfg.py` file replacing the file address with that of whatever file you want to analyze, it'll open a matplotlib window wherein you can zoom in as much as you want without loss of clarity.   

The GUI hasn't been stylized because I first wanted to prioritze the functionality of all the levels and then come back to the styling the UI if time permitted.
